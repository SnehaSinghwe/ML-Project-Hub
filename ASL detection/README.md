# ASL Detector â€“ Real-Time American Sign Language Recognition

*ASL Detector* is an intelligent, real-time hand gesture recognition system that deciphers *American Sign Language (ASL)* alphabets using the magic of computer vision and machine learning. With just a webcam and your hands, you can bridge silence and communication â€” one letter at a time.

## Overview

This project uses *MediaPipe* to detect 21 hand landmarks and a *Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)* classifier to recognize ASL alphabets (Aâ€“Z). It unfolds in three core phases:

1. *Data Collection* â€“ Capture hand landmark data and store it as CSV files.
2. *Model Training* â€“ Train a neural network (MLP) on the landmark dataset.
3. *Real-Time Prediction* â€“ Predict ASL letters live from webcam input.

## Features

- *Real-time* ASL letter detection  
- *21-point* hand landmark tracking using MediaPipe  
- *Aâ€“Z alphabet classification*  
- *Lightweight* and optimized to run on CPU  
- Fully *modular*, easy to extend or adapt
